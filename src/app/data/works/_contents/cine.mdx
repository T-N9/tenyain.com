# Introduction

Immerse yourself in the world of movies through my captivating cinematic information and torrent download website. My goal was to create a user-friendly platform where movie enthusiasts can effortlessly explore the latest movie updates and download torrents. By harnessing the power of the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) for real-time movie data and the [YTS API](https://yts.torrentbay.to/api) for torrent access, I meticulously designed and developed the website from scratch. With the enchanting combination of Next.js, I crafted an intuitive interface that enhances your overall experience, drawing you closer to the mesmerizing realm of cinema.

| Challenge                  | Result                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| API integration            | Up-to-date data          |
| Server-side rendering      | Easy torrent downloading |
| User Experience and Design | Easy movie browsing      |

A key challenge I faced was implementing server-side rendering for movie pages to ensure their visibility and tracking by search engines. This involved optimizing the rendering process, utilizing Next.js, and synchronizing data with the TMDB API. By overcoming this challenge, I aimed to improve search engine visibility and enhance the discoverability of movies on the website.

Users benefited from an up-to-date presentation of movie information, making it a reliable source for the latest details. The integration of the YTS API facilitated easy torrent downloading directly from the website. Additionally, the user-friendly interface enabled effortless browsing of movies, enhancing engagement and satisfaction.

# Development

This is my recent project, and I'm currently working on adding more features and improving the user experience. As a trainee in front-end web development, my focus is on working with different components and managing data flow throughout the app. React.js is a key technology in this project, as it helps me fetch data from various APIs to achieve the project's goals.

With many front-end developers and UI/UX designers honing their skills through cinematic design and development projects, I wanted to approach this project from a different perspective. By thinking outside the box and exploring new ideas, I aim to create a unique output that showcases my abilities as a front-end developer in a distinctive way.

# Preparation

### Cinematic websites

I studied many cinematic sources to inspire and how they maintain a good quality providing information to users. Websites like [**IMDB**](https://www.imdb.com/), [**TMDB**](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and one of the famous torrent sites such as [**YTS.am**](https://yts.mx/) were the main websites that I used to learn both of their features and UX.

### What are the techs?

- Front-end : [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)
- State management : [Redux Toolkit Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
- Styling : [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Design : [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- APIs : [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started), [YTS](https://yts.mx/api)

# Designing

CINE is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different device ratios. To ensure optimal user experiences, I dedicated significant effort to designing user interfaces and thoroughly testing them in Figma. Material design components and icons were utilized to enhance interactions and deliver a superior user experience.
